This Admin Dashboard shows off my grid and advanced HTML/CSS skills. Using a combination of form checks, Grid, and Flexbox, there are many uses of the two different languages to display here.

Apart from this, the admin dashboard also doubles as a way to show off some of my other repos! With links to some of my other projects, it is a pathway into the world of more repositories.

The hardest part of this dashboard was breaking bad habits. I had a bad habit of automatically setting a certain width and height for contents that I would need to grow, and would be puzzled as to why it would stay stagnant and the content inside of it would overflow. This helped me break those habits, and keep the content heights and widths as auto, until further updates were necessary.

I love Grid so much and it pairs extremely well with Flexbox. Overall, they make CSS so much easier to lay out.
